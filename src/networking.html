						<p>The modern Network Campus has evolved greatly in recent years. The traditional layered network with Clearly defined boundaries between, <b>LAN, SD-WAN, Wifi, Access Control and Visibility</b> is blending into something that resembles more of a modern data center. Think of it as a stitched fabric that stretches across and unifies these traditionally siloed components.</p>
						<p>With that in mind, the design of any new or refreshed network takes on a different discussion. The focus shifts from ports and speeds to user mobility, site to site consistency, end to end security tracking and the ability for users to auto-register their own devices onto the network. All the while, ensuring your security risk remains intact.</p>
