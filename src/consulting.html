					<p>While many organizations are already making the move to outsourcing, some are still determined to keep all IT operations in-house.  Hiring IT contractors comes with a multitude of benefits that can help your company limit unnecessary overhead, cut down response time, and avoid falling behind in the marketplace. Your IT team is already spread thin—you need to find a sustainable solution that fills in IT gaps and enables your senior staff to refocus on more critical, strategic tasks.</p>
					<p><b><span class="color-accent">Count on HIGHBIT for your IT Contract Hiring Needs</span> - our global network of IT contractors will supplement your team wherever and whenever you need them the most.</b>  Our IT contracts seamlessly integrate with your teams, attend planning calls, and report on projects—just as you would expect of your full-time staff. </p>
					<p>By outsourcing IT services, any organization can shift its focus towards its core competencies and obtain otherwise unavailable resources. This way, the in-house IT staff⁠—if there is one⁠—has some weight taken off their shoulders, allowing them to tackle other critical issues.</p>
